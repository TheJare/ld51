# Ludum Dare 51 - 10 Seconds of Math

The theme of [Ludum Dare 51 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51) is: **Every 10 seconds**

I squeezed 3 hours over the weekend to end with something decently fun or peculiar. Sorry to say, difficulty escalates savagely very quickly.

> HTML DOM game where you get a new addition exercise every 10 seconds, score for finishing it earlier, and a max of accumulated exercises. Solve them by typing numbers like Z-type and such games.
